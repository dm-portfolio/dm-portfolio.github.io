# DM Portfolio ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20?barColor=99CCFF)
My personal website portfolio!

All code is made by me, a less-than-average programmer, probably with some help from google

> I'm still learning some things, & I've heard things about people attempting to keep up their domains, so I'm not sure what that's all about yet. Here's to hoping my website works for a while. 🤞

## 📝 Documentation

**2.24.26** **-** Website works! Couldn't find a way to host a website for the longest time, so figuring out about github pages fulfilled that lifelong dream of mine to make my own working website. Working on base design so far, more to come in the future. LOTS of ideas ahead. Also added little images with sounds when you click on them.

**2.25.26** **-** Website day 2. Found a CSS wave animation online, later might make a light-mode and dark-mode toggle that changes the color of the waves and everything else.
